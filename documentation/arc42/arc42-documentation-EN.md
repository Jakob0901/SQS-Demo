# 7 Deployment View 

**Content**

The deployment view describes:

- The technical infrastructure used to execute your system, including environments, servers, processors, channels, network topologies, and other infrastructure elements.
- The mapping of (software) building blocks to these infrastructure elements.

**Motivation**

Software does not run without hardware. 
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some cross-cutting concepts. 
Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Level 1

# 8 Cross-cutting Concepts {#section-concepts}

## Authentication

**Purpose**
Prevent unauthorized access to the application and its data by implementing secure authentication mechanisms.

**Implementation**

```python
def require_api_key(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if request.headers.get('x-api-key') == API_KEY:
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            return jsonify({"message": "Forbidden"}), 403

    return decorated_function
```

The implementation of authentication in the application is done using API keys.
It is implemented with a decorator function that checks the API key in the request headers.
If the API key is valid, the request is processed; otherwise, a 403 Forbidden response is returned.

**Impact**

The implementation of authentication in the application ensures that only authorized users can access the API and its resources.

## Tenacity

**Purpose**

The purpose of implementing tenacity in the application is to ensure that the application can handle transient errors and retries requests when necessary.
Transient errors can occur due to network issues, temporary unavailability of services, or other factors that may cause a request to fail.
By implementing tenacity, the application can automatically retry failed requests, improving reliability and user experience.
This is used for the connection with the the third-party API.

**Implementation**

```python
from tenacity import retry

@retry
def get_random_quote(self):
    # do request
    pass
```

The implementation of tenacity in the application is done using the tenacity library.
The `@retry` decorator is used to automatically retry the `get_random_quote` method when it fails.
This is handled in the wrapper class of the API.

**Impact**

The implementation of tenacity in the application ensures that the application can handle transient errors and retries requests when necessary.

## Logging

**Purpose**

The purpose of logging in the application is to provide a mechanism for tracking and recording events, errors, and other important information during the application's execution.
Logging is essential for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining the application, as it allows developers and administrators to understand the application's behavior and identify issues.

**Implementation**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("This is an info message")
```

The implementation of logging in the application is done using the built-in logging module in Python.

**Impact**

The implementation of logging in the application ensures that important events and errors are recorded, allowing developers and administrators to monitor the application's behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.
