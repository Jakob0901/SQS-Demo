# 1 Introduction and Goals 

The primary goal of the MovieQuotes API is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for fetching and saving movie quotes. 
The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use and includes a Web application for easy access.

## Requirements Overview

This section describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include:

- Functional Requirements: The API must allow users to fetch random quotes, search for quotes by author or movie, and save new quotes.
- Functional Requirements: The API must allow users to fetch random quotes, and save new quotes.
- Functional Requirements: The API must allow users to access a Web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
- Functional Requirements: The Web application must allow users to view and save quotes.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The API must be able to handle a growing number of users and quotes without significant performance degradation.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The application must be reliable and robust, with minimal downtime and errors.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The application must be secure, with appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The application must be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Non-Functional Requirements: The API must be performant, scalable, and secure. It should also provide a user-friendly interface for the Web application.

## Quality Goals

The architecture of the application must meet the following quality goals:

- Performance: The application should respond quickly to user interactions, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
- Reliability: The application should be robust and reliable, with minimal downtime and errors.
- Security: User data and interactions should be secure, with appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Usability: The application should be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Maintainability: The codebase should be well-structured and easy to maintain, with clear documentation and a modular design.
