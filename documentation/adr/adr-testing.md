# Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to implement a robust testing strategy for our project to ensure the reliability and quality of our code. This includes unit testing, coverage analysis, and continuous integration to automate the testing process.

## Decision Drivers

* Reliability and quality of the code
* Comprehensive test coverage
* Automation of the testing process
* Integration with the development workflow

## Considered Options

* Using `unittest` and `coverage` with GitHub Actions
* Using `pytest` and `coverage` with GitHub Actions
* Using `unittest` and `coverage` with Jenkins

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using `unittest` and `coverage` with GitHub Actions", because it provides a comprehensive testing framework, integrates well with our existing workflow, and leverages GitHub's native CI/CD capabilities.

### Consequences

* Good, because `unittest` provides a comprehensive testing framework.
* Good, because `coverage` helps ensure comprehensive test coverage.
* Good, because GitHub Actions integrates well with our existing workflow and provides native CI/CD capabilities.
* Bad, because setting up and configuring GitHub Actions may require additional effort.
* Bad, because `unittest` may not be as feature-rich as `pytest`.

### Confirmation

The implementation will be confirmed through comprehensive testing to ensure that all tests pass and coverage meets our standards. Additionally, we will monitor the CI/CD pipeline to ensure it runs smoothly and provides timely feedback.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

* Good, because Jenkins provides robust CI/CD capabilities.
* Neutral, because setting up and configuring Jenkins may require additional effort.
* Bad, because Jenkins may not integrate as well with our existing workflow compared to GitHub Actions.

## More Information

The decision to use `unittest` and `coverage` with GitHub Actions is based on their comprehensive features, integration with our existing workflow, and native CI/CD capabilities. The implementation will be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure it meets our standards for reliability and performance. Future revisits to this decision may be necessary if the project requirements change or if new testing tools become available.

### Implementation Details

1. **Setting Up `unittest`**:
   - Create test cases using `unittest` to cover all critical functionality.
   - Organize test cases in a dedicated directory, e.g., `tests/`.

2. **Setting Up `coverage`**:
   - Use `coverage` to measure test coverage and identify areas that need additional testing.
   - Configure `coverage` to generate reports and enforce minimum coverage thresholds.

3. **Setting Up GitHub Actions**:
   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/test.yml`) to automate the testing process.
   - Configure the workflow to run tests and generate coverage reports on every push and pull request.

#### Example Code

**Test Case Example (`tests/test_example.py`)**:
```python
import unittest

class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(3 - 1, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
