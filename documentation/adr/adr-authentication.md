# API Endpoint Authentication

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to implement authentication for API endpoints that access the database to ensure the security of our application. Other endpoints should remain publicly accessible without requiring authentication. The authentication mechanism should be simple to implement and manage.

## Decision Drivers

* Security for database access
* Simplicity and ease of implementation
* Centralized token management
* Minimal impact on publicly accessible endpoints

## Considered Options

* Using token-based authentication with `functools.wraps`
* Using OAuth 2.0
* Using API keys

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using token-based authentication with `functools.wraps`", because it provides a simple and effective way to secure database-accessing endpoints while keeping other endpoints publicly accessible. The token will be set centrally on program startup, ensuring ease of management.

### Consequences

* Good, because token-based authentication is simple to implement and manage.
* Good, because it ensures that only authorized requests can access the database.
* Bad, because it requires additional code for token validation and management.
* Bad, because tokens need to be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access.

### Confirmation

The implementation will be confirmed through comprehensive testing to ensure that only authorized requests with valid tokens can access the database. Additionally, we will monitor the security and performance of the authentication mechanism to ensure it meets our standards.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using Token-Based Authentication with `functools.wraps`

Token-based authentication using `functools.wraps` provides a simple and effective way to secure API endpoints that access the database. The token will be set centrally on program startup.

* Good, because it is simple to implement and manage.
* Good, because it ensures that only authorized requests can access the database.
* Neutral, because it requires additional code for token validation and management.
* Bad, because tokens need to be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access.

### Using OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authentication framework that provides robust security features. However, it may be more complex to implement and manage compared to token-based authentication.

* Good, because OAuth 2.0 provides robust security features.
* Good, because it is widely used and well-documented.
* Neutral, because it may be more complex to implement and manage.
* Bad, because it may introduce additional overhead and complexity.

### Using API Keys

API keys provide a simple way to authenticate requests. However, they may not be as secure as token-based authentication or OAuth 2.0.

* Good, because API keys are simple to implement and manage.
* Good, because they provide a basic level of security.
* Neutral, because they may not be as secure as other authentication mechanisms.
* Bad, because API keys need to be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access.

## More Information

The decision to use token-based authentication with `functools.wraps` is based on its simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of management. The implementation will be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure it meets our standards for security and performance. Future revisits to this decision may be necessary if the project requirements change or if new authentication mechanisms become available.

### Implementation Details

1. **Token Generation and Storage**:
   - Generate a secure token and store it centrally.
   - Ensure the token is loaded on program startup.

2. **Decorator for Token Authentication**:
   - Create a decorator using `functools.wraps` to wrap around the required endpoints.
   - The decorator will check for the presence and validity of the token in the request headers.

3. **Applying the Decorator**:
   - Apply the decorator to all API endpoints that require database access.
   - Ensure that endpoints without the decorator do not require authentication.

#### Example Code

```python
from functools import wraps
from flask import request, jsonify

# Central token storage
DB_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_secure_token_here"

def token_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
        if token != DB_ACCESS_TOKEN:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Unauthorized access'}), 401
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated

# Example endpoint with token authentication
@app.route('/api/db-access', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def db_access():
    # Your endpoint logic here
    return jsonify({'message': 'Access granted to database'})

# Example endpoint without token authentication
@app.route('/api/public', methods=['GET'])
def public_access():
    # Your endpoint logic here
    return jsonify({'message': 'Public access granted'})
