# Dependencies Management

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to manage dependencies for our Python project effectively to ensure that all required packages are installed and versioned correctly. This will help maintain consistency across different environments and simplify the setup process for new developers.

## Decision Drivers

* Simplicity and ease of use
* Consistency across different environments
* Ease of setup for new developers
* Version management for dependencies

## Considered Options

* Using `setup.py`
* Using `requirements.txt`
* Using `pipenv`

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using `setup.py`", because it provides a comprehensive way to manage dependencies, including versioning and installation. It also integrates well with other Python tools and provides a centralized location for managing project metadata.

### Consequences

* Good, because `setup.py` provides a comprehensive way to manage dependencies, including versioning and installation.
* Good, because it integrates well with other Python tools and provides a centralized location for managing project metadata.
* Bad, because `setup.py` can be more complex to set up and manage compared to `requirements.txt`.
* Bad, because it requires additional configuration for development and production environments.

### Confirmation

The implementation will be confirmed through comprehensive testing to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and versioned. Additionally, we will monitor the consistency and performance of the dependency management process to ensure it meets our standards.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using `setup.py`

`setup.py` provides a comprehensive way to manage dependencies, including versioning and installation. It integrates well with other Python tools and provides a centralized location for managing project metadata.

* Good, because `setup.py` provides a comprehensive way to manage dependencies, including versioning and installation.
* Good, because it integrates well with other Python tools and provides a centralized location for managing project metadata.
* Neutral, because `setup.py` can be more complex to set up and manage compared to `requirements.txt`.
* Bad, because it requires additional configuration for development and production environments.

### Using `requirements.txt`

`requirements.txt` provides a simple way to manage dependencies by listing all required packages and their versions. It is easy to set up and manage but may lack some of the advanced features provided by `setup.py`.

* Good, because `requirements.txt` is simple to set up and manage.
* Good, because it provides a straightforward way to list all required packages and their versions.
* Neutral, because it may lack some of the advanced features provided by `setup.py`.
* Bad, because it does not integrate as well with other Python tools and may not provide a centralized location for managing project metadata.

### Using `pipenv`

`pipenv` provides a modern way to manage dependencies by combining package management and virtual environment management. It is easy to set up and manage but may introduce additional complexity and overhead.

* Good, because `pipenv` provides a modern way to manage dependencies by combining package management and virtual environment management.
* Good, because it is easy to set up and manage.

* Bad, because it may not integrate as well with other Python tools and may not provide a centralized location for managing project metadata.

## More Information

The decision to use `setup.py` is based on its comprehensive features, integration with other Python tools, and centralized location for managing project metadata. The implementation will be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure it meets our standards for consistency and performance. Future revisits to this decision may be necessary if the project requirements change or if new dependency management tools become available.

### Implementation Details

1. **Creating `setup.py`**:
   - Create a `setup.py` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Define the project metadata, including name, version, author, and dependencies.

2. **Defining Dependencies**:
   - List all required packages and their versions in the `install_requires` parameter.
   - Use the `extras_require` parameter to define optional dependencies for development and production environments.

3. **Installing Dependencies**:
   - Use `pip install -e .` to install the project and its dependencies in development mode.
   - Use `pip install .` to install the project and its dependencies in production mode.

#### Example Code

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="your_project_name",
    version="0.1",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'flask>=1.1.2',
        'requests>=2.25.1',
        # Add other dependencies here
    ],
    extras_require={
        'dev': [
            'pytest>=6.2.4',
            'black>=21.5b1',
            # Add other development dependencies here
        ],
        'prod': [
            'gunicorn>=20.1.0',
            # Add other production dependencies here
        ],
    },
