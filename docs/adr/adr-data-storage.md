# Data Storage

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a reliable and scalable data storage solution for our application. The solution should be easy to set up, manage, and scale, while ensuring data persistence and integrity. Using a PostgreSQL database within a Docker container with a volume attached for storage provides a robust and flexible solution.

## Decision Drivers

* Reliability and scalability of the data storage solution
* Ease of setup, management, and scaling
* Data persistence and integrity
* Integration with our existing infrastructure

## Considered Options

* Using PostgreSQL database within a Docker container with a volume attached for storage
* Using a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
* Using a traditional on-premise database server

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using PostgreSQL database within a Docker container with a volume attached for storage", because it provides a robust and flexible solution that is easy to set up, manage, and scale. It also ensures data persistence and integrity while integrating well with our existing infrastructure.

### Consequences

* Good, because PostgreSQL is a reliable and scalable database solution.
* Good, because Docker containers provide a flexible and portable environment for running the database.
* Good, because volumes ensure data persistence and integrity.
* Bad, because setting up and managing a Docker container may require additional effort.
* Bad, because ensuring data backup and recovery may require additional configuration.

### Confirmation

The implementation will be confirmed through comprehensive testing to ensure that the database is set up correctly, data is persisted, and the solution meets our standards for reliability and performance. Additionally, we will monitor the database and Docker container to ensure they run smoothly and provide timely feedback.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using PostgreSQL Database within a Docker Container with a Volume Attached for Storage

PostgreSQL is a reliable and scalable database solution. Docker containers provide a flexible and portable environment for running the database, and volumes ensure data persistence and integrity.

* Good, because PostgreSQL is a reliable and scalable database solution.
* Good, because Docker containers provide a flexible and portable environment for running the database.
* Good, because volumes ensure data persistence and integrity.
* Neutral, because setting up and managing a Docker container may require additional effort.
* Bad, because ensuring data backup and recovery may require additional configuration.

### Using a Managed Database Service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)

Managed database services provide a reliable and scalable solution with minimal setup and management effort. However, they may introduce additional costs and dependencies on external providers.

* Good, because managed database services provide a reliable and scalable solution.
* Good, because they require minimal setup and management effort.
* Neutral, because they may introduce additional costs.
* Bad, because they may introduce dependencies on external providers.

### Using a Traditional On-Premise Database Server

Traditional on-premise database servers provide a reliable and scalable solution with full control over the infrastructure. However, they may require significant setup and management effort.

* Good, because traditional on-premise database servers provide a reliable and scalable solution.
* Good, because they provide full control over the infrastructure.
* Neutral, because they may require significant setup and management effort.
* Bad, because they may not integrate as well with modern infrastructure and deployment practices.

## More Information

The decision to use a PostgreSQL database within a Docker container with a volume attached for storage is based on its reliability, scalability, and flexibility. The implementation will be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure it meets our standards for performance and data integrity. Future revisits to this decision may be necessary if the project requirements change or if new data storage solutions become available.

### Implementation Details

1. **Setting Up PostgreSQL in a Docker Container**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to define the PostgreSQL image and configuration.
   - Use `docker-compose` to define the PostgreSQL service and volume for data storage.

2. **Configuring the Volume**:
   - Define a volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure data persistence.
   - Configure the volume to store PostgreSQL data and ensure data integrity.

3. **Running the Docker Container**:
   - Use `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL container with the attached volume.
   - Monitor the container and volume to ensure they run smoothly and provide timely feedback.

#### Example Code

**Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM postgres\:latest

# Set environment variables for PostgreSQL
ENV POSTGRES_USER=your_user
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
ENV POSTGRES_DB=your_database

# Copy initialization scripts if needed
# COPY init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

EXPOSE 5432
