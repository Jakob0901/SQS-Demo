## Context and Problem Statement

We need to develop a wrapper around the MovieQuotes API to simplify its usage and provide additional functionality. 
The wrapper should be robust, scalable, and maintainable. 
As the sole developer, I need to make architectural decisions that ensure the wrapper meets these requirements.

## Decision Drivers

* Familiarity with Flask and Python
* Need for a robust and scalable solution
* Ease of maintenance and future extensibility
* Performance and efficiency

## Considered Options

* Using Flask and Python
* Using Django and Python
* Using FastAPI and Python

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using Flask and Python", because it aligns with my familiarity and expertise, and it provides the necessary tools and libraries to build a robust and scalable wrapper.

### Consequences

* Good, because Flask is lightweight and easy to use, which speeds up development.
* Good, because Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can be leveraged for additional functionality.
* Bad, because Flask may not be as feature-rich as Django or FastAPI, which could limit some advanced functionalities.

### Confirmation

The implementation will be confirmed through comprehensive unit and integration testing. Additionally, performance metrics will be monitored to ensure the wrapper meets the desired performance standards.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using Flask and Python

Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for Python. It is well-suited for developing small to medium-sized applications and provides the necessary tools for building a robust wrapper.

* Good, because Flask is lightweight and easy to use, which speeds up development.
* Good, because Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can be leveraged for additional functionality.
* Neutral, because Flask may not be as feature-rich as Django or FastAPI, which could limit some advanced functionalities.
* Bad, because Flask may require additional libraries for advanced features, which could increase complexity.

### Using Django and Python

Django is a high-level web framework for Python that provides a wide range of features out of the box. It is well-suited for developing large-scale applications and provides robust tools for building a scalable wrapper.

* Good, because Django provides a wide range of features out of the box, which can speed up development.
* Good, because Django has a strong community and extensive documentation, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
* Neutral, because Django may be overkill for a small to medium-sized wrapper, which could increase complexity.
* Bad, because Django has a steeper learning curve compared to Flask, which could slow down development.

### Using FastAPI and Python

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is well-suited for developing high-performance APIs and provides robust tools for building a scalable wrapper.

* Good, because FastAPI is designed for high performance, which can improve the efficiency of the wrapper.
* Good, because FastAPI has built-in support for asynchronous operations, which can improve performance.
* Neutral, because FastAPI may require additional libraries for some features, which could increase complexity.
* Bad, because FastAPI is relatively new compared to Flask and Django, which could limit community support and documentation.

## More Information

The decision to use Flask and Python is based on my familiarity and expertise with these tools. The implementation will be monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure it meets the desired standards. Future revisits to this decision may be necessary if the project requirements change or if new tools and technologies become available.
